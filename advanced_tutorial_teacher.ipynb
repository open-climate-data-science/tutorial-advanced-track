We will be using R studio for today's session. \n\nWe will be tackling these objectives:\n\n- *Define* open data and reproducible science\n- *Recognize* the importance of statistical analysis for climate data analysis using cloud based data\n- *Apply* techniques to access and explore publicly available climate data from the cloud using exploratory data analysis (i.e. tidyverse)\n- *Create* statistical model to predicts results for a representative case study","metadata":{},"id":"78709032-78cd-4f58-b69e-d9ceded84e26"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Meet Suzie!\n\nMr. Wuf works for Mount Mitchell State Park in Burnsville, NC and was recently asked by his boss to write a report summarizing rainfall and temperature data for 2021. This report will be used to help optimize 2022 event planning (e.g., fall color viewing) for park visitors and maintenance scheduling for park staff. He recently got promoted to the head office of the NC State Climate office! Mr. Wuf’s wife, Mrs. Wuf, recently told him about the State Climate Office of North Carolina’s new nClimgrid and Econet data portals. He agrees with her that it would be a great opportunity to check out these new, free tools. After some preliminary sleuthing around nClimgrid, he discovered there was a Monthly U.S Climate Gridded Dataset (nClimGrid; https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/metadata/landing-page/bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.ncdc:C00332). How did he miss this? Once he downloads these data from nClimGrid and Econet, Mr. Wuf plans to put the skills he learned in an online R programming course to the test for this real-world, work-related project.\\\n\n\n![Suzie](images/suzie.png)","metadata":{},"id":"eae08236-c5c6-4f29-b81f-02d3bf30164f"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Importing Data\n\n### Cloud Based Data Introduction \n\n- Cloud storage is a service model in which data is transmitted and stored on remote storage systems, where it is maintained, managed, backed up and made available to users over a network\n\n- Cloud based data is stored in logical pools across storage servers located on premises or in a data center managed by a third party cloud provider such as amazon web services (aws)\n\n\n![](images/cloud_data.jpg)","metadata":{},"id":"35359720-e152-4db6-ab46-8dc462282832"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### nClimGrid Data Set\n\n- The NOAA Daily U.S. Climate Gridded Dataset (nClimGrid) consists of four climate variables derived from the station observation networks: maximum temperature, minimum temperature, average temperature and precipitation. \n\n- Each file provides daily values in a 5 x 5 kilometers grid for the Continental United States.
